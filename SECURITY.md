# Security & Redaction Guidelines

This repository contains **unofficial** and **reverse‑engineered** documentation.

- Do **not** commit secrets: tokens, cookies, API keys, private emails, phone numbers.
- Redact IDs that can be tied to real people. Use placeholders like `REDACTED`.
- Avoid including full timestamps if unnecessary; consider truncation.
- If you believe something sensitive slipped in, open a removal PR immediately.

If you represent Skylight and want something removed, open an issue or PR and we’ll comply.
